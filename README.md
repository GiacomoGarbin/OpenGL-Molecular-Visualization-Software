# OpenGL-Molecular-Visualization-Software

This was my master's thesis project.

I developed a molecular visualization software from scratch, implementing several computer graphics techniques such as Impostors and Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion, and designed a rendering algorithm to communicate key properties in molecular simulation.
